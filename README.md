# cfg-python
final project for code first girls

Two Python projects using APIs to fetch recipes. 

**Cocktail** uses a cocktail recipe API and returns cocktails based on user input (search by ingredient[s] or spirit).

**Food** uses a food recipe API and returns different food recipes based on user input (search by ingredient[s], remove search results based on allergies).
